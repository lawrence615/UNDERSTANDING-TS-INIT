Initial project template to be used in the understanding typescript journey.

## Project setup

Use the terminal and navigate to the project, run the commands below inside the project.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Start development server

```bash
yarn start
```

NB: This will open the app on the browser: http://localhost:3000/

## New changes
Leave the development server running.

Open another tab on the terminal; after making changes to app.ts, run the command below
